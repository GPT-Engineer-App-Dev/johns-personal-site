# johns-personal-site

Create a home page for a personal website about John Quincy Adams, the 6th U.S. President. 

The page should include:
- A header with John Quincy Adams' name
- A navigation menu to other pages (can link to placeholder pages for now)
- A hero section with a portrait of John Quincy Adams and a headline
- A brief biography section highlighting his early life, political career, presidency, and later years
- A footer with relevant links

Use a classic, elegant design style suitable for a historical political figure. Incorporate patriotic colors like navy blue and deep red.
